In this project we intend to build a website which will include basic recipes. This will pull on material coverd from our prior lessons which include: 
Using the correct syntax, from memory if possible, to create our basic html boilerplate.
Using html attributes correctly to provide web security and to allow screen-readers or text-to-sound programs to correctly interpret the contents.
Using the commandline appropriately 
using git commit (and commit messages) often and appropriately, following common conventions, to create a comprehensive compilation of the projects progress over time. This is for my benefit as a coder, also for the benefit of any collaborators and to provide evidence to prospective employers of good conduct.
